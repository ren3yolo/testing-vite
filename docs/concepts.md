## react-dom/client - These APIs lets us render React Components on the client.

1. createRoot - creates a root that renders our React App.

2. hydrateRoot - displays a React App inside a DOM node whose content was previously rendered by server-side.

## lazy loading - - This lets us defer a component's code until it is rendered for the first time.
